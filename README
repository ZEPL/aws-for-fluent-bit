## AWS for Fluent Bit Docker Image

#### CMs

Use `make release` to build the image. To run the integration tests, run `make integ`.

#### Developing Features in the AWS Plugins

You can build a version of the image with code in your GitHub fork.

Set the following environment variables for CloudWatch:

```
export CLOUDWATCH_PLUGIN_CLONE_URL="Your GitHub fork clone URL"
export CLOUDWATCH_PLUGIN_BRANCH="Your branch on your fork"
```

Or for Firehose:
```
export CLOUDWATCH_PLUGIN_CLONE_URL="Your GitHub fork clone URL"
export CLOUDWATCH_PLUGIN_BRANCH="Your branch on your fork"
```

Then run `make cloudwatch-dev` or `make firehose-dev` to build the image with your changes.

To run the integration tests on your code, run `make integ-cloudwatch-dev` or `make integ-firehose-dev`.
